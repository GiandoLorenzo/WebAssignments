              <p class="card-text">John David McAfee was a British-American computer programmer, businessman, and two-time presidential candidate who unsuccessfully sought the Libertarian Party nomination for president of the United States in 2016 and in 2020. In 1987, he wrote the first commercial anti-virus software, founding McAfee Associates to sell his creation. He resigned in 1994 and sold his remaining stake in the company. McAfee became the company's most vocal critic in later years, urging consumers to uninstall the company's anti-virus software, which he characterized as bloatware. He disavowed the company's continued use of his name in branding, a practice that has persisted in spite of a short-lived corporate rebrand attempt under Intel ownership.</p>

          <h3>Career</h3>
          <p>
            He initially worked for NASA, Univac, Xerox, and Lockheed Martin before starting his own company2.
            McAfee Associates quickly became a leader in the antivirus industry, and McAfee himself became a prominent figure in cybersecurity. He resigned from the company in 1994 and sold his remaining stake1. After leaving McAfee Associates, he founded several other companies, including Tribal Voice, which developed one of the first instant messaging programs, PowWow1.

          <h3>Controversies</h3>
          <p>His life was marked by significant achievements and controversies. After founding McAfee Associates in 1987, he became a pioneer in cybersecurity. However, his later years were filled with legal troubles and eccentric behavior.

            McAfee faced numerous legal issues, including tax evasion charges in the U.S. and being a person of interest in a murder case in Belize. He was arrested in Spain in 2020 and was found dead in his prison cell in 2021, an apparent suicide. His life story is a mix of innovation, adventure, and controversy.</p>
